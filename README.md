## **Hello, and Welcome!**
 
My name is Ashwin. Hi.
I am creating this set of 'colab notebooks' to help instruct beginners in their quest to learn coding, on Python.
 
A bit about me: I am an teacher, researcher, and programmer who also loves filter coffee.
 
On a serious note, I am glad you are here! Hopefully I will hold your attention for a while longer so that we can learn some real programming and have some fun with Python!

# **FAQ's**


Some additional documentation and possible questions.

<h2>What is this tutorial series about?</h2>

Through these tutorials I hope to support a <b>beginner-friendly learning experience in Python programming</b>. The primary purpose of this is to supplement **guided instruction sessions** where I help a group of you work through these tutorials systematically.

The aim is to take you from someone who may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with programming, to someone who can confidently write code in Python.

Along the way I also hope to incorporate some basic <b>data literacy</b>. This means that by the end of this course you should be able to make simple graphs/plots like scatterplots and histograms, with a clear understanding of what is being plotted and how.

<h2>How do I access and use the tutorials?</h2>

Scroll down to course contents. There is a list of modules, along with a link to the appropriate colab notebook. Open them in colab, and ideally save a copy to your local disk (ctrl + S) so that you may save changes as you work through the material.


<h2>What will the Guided Sessions be like?</h2>


The sessions will be conducted online, probably through Zoom, depending on the year and whether my government has banned it by then. 

Importantly it is a **hands-on** course. This means that much of what you will be doing in a given session is **writing programs** rather than listening to me or someone else lecture you for 2 hours. 

Briefly speaking - all students will be discussing coding problems, sharing insights with each other, and taking turns to share their work (with the 'share screen' option). I will be supervising of course, making things simpler and guiding the discussions and efforts. When done right it is a fun and active process, and you can learn a lot rather quickly!

<h2>Why does one code? Why is it a good idea to learn to code?</h2>


[Note: 'coding' and 'programming' usually mean the same thing.]


Your reasons to learn to code can be professional and personal. For me it is primarily personal - I code because I enjoy using it to analyse data, to teach maths and science, and to help me think out of one box (my tiny head) and into another.

In general if you are in a scientific or quantitative field, learning to code opens up many doors. 

Coding also has a lot of relevence to creative fields. Game development requires programming knowledge, as does animation and sound engineering. [Some performance artists brilliantly combine entertainment and programming skills to deliver justice in the world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1LLFQ0TTeU)

Most of all, programming is fun. Whatever you do for a living, coding is relevant and will add value to your life simply because it involves logical thinking, mental organization, and creative problem solving.



<h2>Do I need to know XYZ computer language before attempting this tutorial?</h2>

No. I am assuming minimal computer or programming knowledge while making this. 

<h2>Will I become a master programmer at the end of this tutorial series?</h2>

No. One does not simply become a master programmer over a few weeks. Even the most experienced programmers would admit that they have much and more to learn.

There is an entire universe of things that can be done with Python, and with programming in general. This universe has [beautifully animated graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qgreAUpPwM), [potentially fun gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oej7DQQjSfY), [new avenues in research and data analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKSWAlvXSmw), [industries touted to transform the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhCzX0iLnOc), and <a href="https://devrant.com/rants/1814784/the-programmers-wife-tells-him-run-to-the-store-and-pick-up-a-loaf-of-bread-if-t">some truly awful jokes</a>. This series aims to take you from a place where this universe is either invisible or only barely visible, to where you can see it clearly and take your first steps in it. Thereafter, it is upto you to choose what to do with it and to work on the specific skillset that will enrich your life, be it research, game design, data mining, animation, or something else.

<h2>Is there a certificate of completion?</h2>

No. The only takeaway from this is whatever you will have learned, which I hope will be significant.

# **Course Contents**

The course is going to be divided into multiple modules, each contained in a different collab notebook.

I expect each guided session of 2 hours to be sufficient for one module, but given the interactive, student-driven approach, the pacing may vary from batch to batch.
