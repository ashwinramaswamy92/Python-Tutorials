        "We are shortly going to jump straight into writing some code. But first, I want to talk a bit about the general idea of programming and Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h1>What is programming?</h1>\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply, programming means talking to a computer. As much as we like Rajnikanth's 2.0, our average computer cannot understand human language very well. Therefore, in order to make a computer to do interesting things for us, we need to learn to speak in a computer language.\n",
        "\n",
        "What does computer language look like? Well at the heart of it, a computer is a set of binary switches. Any interaction we have with it must ultimately be expressed in 0's and 1's. So will all our programs invove learning how to write precise binary sequences? For example: maybe typing 00110001000011100001111010 means 'open movies folder'?\n",
        "\n",
        "Although this is close to the truth about how programs work fundamentally, this would be a nightmare for humans to deal with all the time. Can you imagine learning uncountable number of such sequences of 0's and 1's for every different thing you'd want your computer to do for you?\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately though, computer engineers have over the decades worked very hard to make programming instructions closer and closer to human language. This has got us to the point where programming is no longer an extremely difficult and painful skill available only to a few IBM employees, but something anyone with access to a computer and basic typing skills can learn and enjoy. \n",
        "\n",
        "This has also led to the creation of many computer 'languages' over the years, such as 'COBOL', 'BASIC', 'C', 'Java', and of course 'Python'. A key difference between all the many languages is how close each language is to human language. Older languages such as COBOL tend to be difficult for humans to read and write in, but newer ones like Python are often much closer to human languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "What this means for us is that as beginners to programming it would be wise to pick a language that is easy for us to understand and write. We want our computer to do interesting things for us, while communicating with it in a simple manner. Fortunately Python happens to be just such a language - it is very popular and high in demand in some industries because of its wide functionality, while being not too complicated to understand."
